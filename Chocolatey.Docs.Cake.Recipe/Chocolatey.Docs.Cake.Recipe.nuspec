    <summary>Opinionated set of scripts for use with Cake Builds for the various Chocolatey documentation sites.</summary>
    <description>
This NuGet package contains a set of re-usable scripts that is intended for use to build the various Chocolatey documentation sites, by adding a single load pre-processor directive to your main Cake Script.  As a result, it is possible to use the same set of build scripts across multiple projects, without having to duplicate the scripts.  All that is required is a small recipe build script, which sets the project specific information.  It is not intended that the scripts within this package will be usable by everyone, as there will be decisions/conventions that are specific to how we build things at Chocolatey Software, Inc.
